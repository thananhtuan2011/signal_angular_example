# Angular 18 Fetch Signals Example

This repository demonstrates the use of Angular 18's new signal-based state management approach in a practical web application. The example focuses on building a responsive menu system where categories and products are dynamically loaded and displayed. The project illustrates how to effectively utilize Angular 18's latest features, including the `@if` and `@for` control flows, signals and fetch, to create modular, clean, and maintainable code.

## Key features:

- Signal-Based State Management: Showcases how to manage application state reactively using signals, enabling efficient updates and state tracking across components.
- Modular Component Structure: Implements a clear separation of concerns where each component is responsible for a single functionality, enhancing reusability and maintainability.
- Dynamic Data Fetching: Demonstrates fetching data asynchronously using the modern JavaScript fetch API combined with Angular's signal system to handle categories and products data.
- Error Handling and Loading States: Includes patterns for managing loading states and error handling gracefully in an Angular 18 application.

Perfect for developers looking to understand the new capabilities of Angular 18, especially those interested in the improved reactivity and cleaner code structure offered by signals.
